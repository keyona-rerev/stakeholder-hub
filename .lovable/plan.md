## Pages & Structure

### 1. Homepage (Overview)
- **Hero section** with bold headline, tagline, and two CTAs (Catalyst Fund / Fund I) on a clean white or very light background — no heavy gradient overlay
- **"Two Funds, One Mission"** section with a brief narrative and two side-by-side comparison cards (Fund I vs Catalyst Fund) showing key stats (target size, stage, LP minimum, status)
- **Leadership section** with clean avatar cards for Bryan and Keyona with titles and one-liner descriptions
- Smooth scroll animations as sections come into view

### 2. Catalyst Fund
- Clean stat bar at the top ($500K–$2M, Pre-Seed, Through 2026, $10K min)
- **Equivesto Partnership** section with icon-driven feature cards (compliant fundraising, lower costs, escrow, access)
- **Investment strategy** details: thesis areas, check sizes, portfolio construction
- **Fund terms** comparison table (management fee, carry, deployment timeline)
- Clear CTA to contact / express interest

### 3. Fund I
- Stat bar (same style as Catalyst page) — $15M, 4 years, Pre-Seed to Seed, On Pause
- **Original Vision** narrative section
- **"From Blueprint to Build"** callout explaining the strategic pause
- Bullet points on shared thesis, team, and values
- Fund structure details and terms table

### 4. Opportunities (Pipeline / Thesis)
- Visual overview of ClimateTech focus areas
- Target founder profile and investment criteria
- Any pipeline or portfolio highlights

### 5. Contact

- No backend needed — just static contact details or a mailto button

## Design System
- **Color palette**: Primarily white/light gray backgrounds, dark navy text, with a single accent color (teal or gold) for highlights and CTAs
- **Typography**: Large, confident headings with a modern sans-serif font feel
- **Cards & sections**: Subtle borders or light shadows, rounded corners, plenty of padding
- **Navigation**: Clean top navbar with the BlackTech Capital wordmark on the left, page links on the right, and a highlighted "Contact" button
